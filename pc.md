## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
Git is a tool used for code management and version control.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
 Git allows you to manage and keep track of your code while Github is a hosting service that allows you to manage Git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? 
We create the branch so that we can isolate our changes and make sure they are safe and working before we add them to the main code.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? 
A pull request allows you to show others what changes you have made to your branch before it is approved for implementation. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. 
The Command is "Git Switch "Branch to be changed to".
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
Git fetch checks the meta data to see if there are any changes available. Git pull checks for changes and copies them from the remote repository. Git merge takes the individual Commits and puts them together.
7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
You can open each file individually and fix where the conflict is occuring.
